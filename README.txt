This is the semester long project I did with 4 other classmates for our operating systems class. The project is meant to represent a process scheduler in an operating system. Individual tasks can be added, or a ‘program’ file of several tasks can be uploaded. In either case the program gives a window into how the tasks are organized and completed given one of the several commonly used scheduling algorithms  (Round Robin, FCFS, etc.). Any given task will have the number of cycles it needs to be completed, I/O frequency + length. Context switch penalties can be added in later phases to make it more realistic.

One other team member and I did the majority of the coding. Each of the phases represent the different parts of the project that we had to turn something in for, with the Word documents being the assignment for the given phase.

---------- Directions to Run ----------
For any given phase (phase 4 is the best/final iteration) run the file called Gui_<phase #>.py. The algorithms for the process selection are all in the files called Data_Structures_<phase #>.py
